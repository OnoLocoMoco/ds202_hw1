```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This homework is more or less a tutorial that helps you set up the coding environment used in this course, and familiarizes you with the format of the assignment submission. 
As a pre-requisite of this homework, first install R, and then the RStudio (the free version of Rstudio Desktop). 

1. Create a folder named `ds202_hw1`, and **either** create an RMarkDown file `hw1.Rmd` under this folder **or** move the provided template into this folder. `hw1.Rmd` will include your solutions. The file and folder names are *case-sensitive*, which means `hw1.Rmd` and `HW1.rmd` are different. *It is crucial to follow the exact folder structure and file names* in this course, so that your homework can be reproduced. The correct folder structure is

    ```
    ds202_hw1
    |-- hw1.Rmd
    |-- hw1.html (generated after knitting)
    ```
    
    Done

2. Write your name in the YAML of your homework `Rmd` file.

    Done

3. Write a paragraph to introduce yourself. Set your name in bold font and your major in italic. 

    Hello, my name is **Jay Maxwell** and I just switched from the Computer Science program to the *Data Science* degree program. I am also pursuing a minor in Geographic Information Systems, which is offered by the Community and Regional Planning department of the College of Design. I am a non-traditional student and this is my second year back to school as a "grown up." This semester I am also taking Calculus 3, Discrete Mathematics, Intermediate Statistics and GIS Programming and Automation. I will be doing a lot of programming and math.
  
4. Write a paragraph describing a job that you think is related to data science. Include a hyperlink and an image. Make sure your answer is in a nice format to read. 

    I would have to bring up a GIS analyst as a possible career which can use data science skills. A GIS analyst uses specific tools and technology to find spatial relations between data and produce maps and graphics visualizing the data. A lot of Data Science processes and techniques would be utilized by GIS professionals to gather, prepare, analyze and present results using high quality charts and maps.

    The State of Iowa offers a great deal of geographic and spatial data at this web site: [Iowa GeoData](https://geodata.iowa.gov/ "Iowa Geo Data"). Most other states and many federal agencies also provide GIS data to the public.   
  
5. What data topic will you be most interested in? (Optional) Provide a source of such dataset if you have.

    From a quick read over of the syllabus, I noticed a section on mapping. Visualizing data by plotting it in maps using R something I am very interested in. There is a lot of GIS data available from a wide range of county, state and federal agencies. I know that R is commonly used in spatial analysis and I am happy to lear this new language. [Iowa GeoData](https://geodata.iowa.gov/) provides a variety of GIS data for the state. 
  
6. To check that your R and Rstudio installation is correct, find the version of R by entering `version` into the R console. Include this command into a R code trunk in your solution `Rmd` file to have it automatically printed in the knitted html file. 

    ```{r echo=FALSE}
    version
    ```
  
7. Install git. 
    - If you are on Windows: 
        a. Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). In the coming weeks we will use the Git Bash (but not the Git GUI). 
        b. After installation, set up Rstudio to use Git bash as the shell for the Terminal: Open RStudio, click Tools--Global Options--Terminal; under **Shells**, select Git Bash; click OK. 
        c. In the main menu of RStudio: click Tools--Terminal--New Terminal. If you have a `$` before your prompt, then you should be good to go.
    - If you are on Linux or macOS, Git has probably been installed by default, so you do not need to install anything. Just click the Terminal tab (above the R Console).

    Answer: Yes, Done. 
  
8. What is the version of your Git? To find out, go to the Terminal tab in RStudio (right to the Console tab), and type in the following command. If it works, this shows that the setup of your terminal and Git is correct. 
<!-- Then explore the bash command line and Git. -->

    ```
    git --version
    ```

    A2.28.0.windows.1
  
9. Configure your git username and user email by modifying and entering the following commands into the terminal

    ```
    git config --global user.name "your first and last name"
    git config --global user.email "yourEmail"
    ```

    Complete
  

10. Register a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account. What is your username?
